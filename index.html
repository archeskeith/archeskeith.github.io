My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 22, because it involves using Java, a good programming language.
My favorite GE so far is SAS 1, because it involves reflection of self.
My favorite PL so far is Java, because it is all about OOP, or object-oriented programming, one which I think is easiest and most organized setup to work.
I like ramen. A lot.
