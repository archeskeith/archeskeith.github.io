My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 22, because it involves using Java, a good programming language.<br>
My favorite GE so far is SAS 1, because it involves reflection of self.<br>
My favorite PL so far is Java, because it is all about OOP, or object-oriented programming, one which I think is easiest and most organized setup to work.<br>
I like ramen. A lot.<br>
