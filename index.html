<h3>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 22, because it involves using Java, a good programming language.</h3><br>
<h4>My favorite GE so far is SAS 1, because it involves reflection of self.</h4><br>
<h5>My favorite PL so far is Java, because it is all about OOP, or object-oriented programming, one which I think is easiest and most organized setup to work.</h5><br>
<h6>I like ramen. A lot.</h6><br>
